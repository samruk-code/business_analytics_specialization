Business Analytics

After completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I took business analytics as a career. To strengthen my knowledge in business analytics, I took this course specialization in Coursera. These courses thought my University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign professors and it also parts of their iMBA program. After successfully completing this program, I feel confident about my skill in business analytics. Some projects I put this repository on when I did at the Business Analytics Specialisation. Thank you.
